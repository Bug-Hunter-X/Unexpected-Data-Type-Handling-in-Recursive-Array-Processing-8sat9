This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in PHP involving unexpected data type handling during array iteration within a recursive function. The `bug.php` file contains the buggy code, which throws an exception only for unexpected types. The improved `bugSolution.php` file provides a more robust solution by using a more flexible approach to handle different types within the array, preventing unexpected errors and improving overall code reliability.  The solution implements better error handling and type checking.
